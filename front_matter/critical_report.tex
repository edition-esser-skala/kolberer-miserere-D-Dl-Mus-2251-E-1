               revised by Jan Dismas Zelenka. It is unclear whether the
               abbreviation “G:K:” on the title page truly refers to
               Kolberer as the author. \\
  –   & ob   & The directives “Tutti” and “Vv.” in the violin parts
               indicate the beginning and end of segments
               where the oboes should play unison with the violins.
               Based on these directives, the oboe parts of this edition
               have been assembled. \\
